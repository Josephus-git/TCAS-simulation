// LandingDuration defines how long a landing operation physically lasts.

// Land handles the process of a plane landing at an airport.
// It verifies the plane's intended destination, strictly manages runway availability,
// simulates the landing process, and updates the plane's and the global simulation's states.
//
// Parameters:
//
//	plane: The Plane struct that is attempting to land. This is passed by value;
//	       its modifications will be reflected when it's re-added to the airport's list.
//	simState: A pointer to the global SimulationState, necessary for removing the plane
//	          from the `PlanesInFlight` list.
//
// Returns:
//
//	error: An error if the landing cannot proceed (e.g., wrong destination,
//	       runways are currently in use, or the plane is not found in flight).
