// It handles runway allocation, flight path generation, and state transitions for the plane and airport.
//
// Parameters:
//
//	plane: The Plane struct that is taking off. Note that this is passed by value;
//	       the modifications to this copy are then reflected when it's added to simState.PlanesInFlight.
//	simState: A pointer to the global SimulationState, allowing updates to the list of planes in flight.
//
// Returns:
//
//	*Flight: A pointer to the newly created Flight struct representing this takeoff.
//	error: An error if the takeoff cannot be initiated (e.g., no available runways, plane not found).
